    <string name="correction_bolus">
        NOTE:
        You should not need to correct a high blood glucose with each meal. If you need insulin to
        correct high blood glucose often, the insulin dose may need to be changed at each meal. The
        goal is to predict and prevent high blood glucose.\n
        \n
        Do not use the correction bolus if:\n
        -Your blood glucose is lower than your correction target\n
        -It has been less than 3 hours since your last meal or correction bolus\n
        -It has been less than 1 hour since intense exercise\n
        -At bedtime or during the night unless told otherwise\n
